<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Hello and welcome to the RCA VM codename <strong>Robuntu</strong>. <br />
This machine contains all the tools that are required for software development
of our robots. <br />
Most of this work is done in the terminal using command line tools.</p>

<p>We recommend that you let us help you with your first steps, so that it is less
frustrating for you if something does not work how you want it. <br />
We can help and show you how we use it.</p>

<p>When a new VM with new tools is released, we will provide you with instructions
to upgrade your existing VM whenever possible. <br />
If you use a Linux or Unix distribution as your home OS, you can also try to install the
tools natively instead of booting into this VM. <br />
Talk to us about were to find instructions and experiences about a native installation.</p>

<p>Remember to connect your USB programmers to this VM and not the host OS! <br />
Otherwise you cannot flash your microcontrollers.</p>
