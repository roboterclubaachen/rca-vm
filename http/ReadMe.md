To start double-click on the **`init.sh`** script on the desktop and follow its instructions.

You may then launch eclipse and check out our projects.

Hello and welcome to the RCA VM codename **Robuntu**.  
This machine contains all the tools that are required for software development
of our robots.  
Most of this work is done in the terminal using command line tools.

We recommend that you let us help you with your first steps, so that it is less
frustrating for you if something does not work how you want it.  
We can help and show you how we use it.

When a new VM with new tools is released, we will provide you with instructions
to upgrade your existing VM whenever possible.  
If you use a Linux or Unix distribution as your home OS, you can also try to install the
tools natively instead of booting into this VM.  
Talk to us about were to find instructions and experiences about a native installation.

Remember to connect your USB programmers to this VM and not the host OS!  
Otherwise you cannot flash your microcontrollers.
